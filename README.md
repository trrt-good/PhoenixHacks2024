TeachMax: Empowering Teachers to Empower Students
The Problem: Teacher Burnout and the Consequences
The United States is facing a critical issue in its education system: teacher burnout. According to a report by Delvin Peck (2024), K-12 teachers are the #1 most burnt-out profession in the United States, with 44% of teachers reporting often or always feeling burnout. This staggering statistic has severe consequences, including a high turnover rate, with over half of teachers saying they will leave teaching sooner than originally planned (Peck, 2024). The impact on students is significant, as teacher turnover can lead to a decline in student achievement and a loss of institutional knowledge (Steiner et al., 2022).

The Importance of Good Teachers
Good teachers are the backbone of a good education system. They play a crucial role in shaping young minds, fostering critical thinking, and inspiring creativity. Research has consistently shown that teachers have a significant impact on student outcomes, with effective teachers leading to higher student achievement and better educational outcomes (Chetty et al, 2011). However, the current state of teacher burnout and dissatisfaction threatens the very foundation of our education system.

The Inspiration Behind TeachMax
We all have Mr. Conlin as our Calculus BC teacher, and while he is an exceptional teacher and really kind, we couldn't help but notice how exhasted he always seemed. He'd casually mention in class that he was up till 4am grading our tests, just to get to school at 6 am to continue grading or answering emails. That got us thinking about teacher wellbeing and how it relates to K12 education quality. Remembering the famous Steiner et al. study after Covid-19 that quantified the reality of teacher burnout epidemic in the US, we decided to target this issue by developing three AI tools, making up TeachMax.

Building TeachMax
TeachMax is an AI-powered tool suite designed to alleviate the administrative burden on teachers, freeing them up to focus on what they do best: educating and providing personalized help to their students.

Test Variations: Create multiple versions of tests in minutes, saving teachers hours of time.
AI Chat Interface: Create personalized AI chat interfaces for students to interact with, freeing up teachers to focus on high-touch, high-impact activities.
Auto Grading: Automate grading for writing assignments based on rubrics, reducing the grading burden and allowing teachers to assign more formative assignments.
What's Next for TeachMax
Our immediate next step is to fully deploy TeachMax at Monta Vista, rigorously test it with our teachers, and gather feedback to refine the tool suite. Once we have a proven product, we plan to expand TeachMax to other schools in FUHSD to demonstrate its scalability and adaptability. In the long term, our vision is to make TeachMax available nationwide, empowering teachers with AI-powered tools to improve education quality and the well-being of both teachers and students, while continuing to invest in research and development to ensure TeachMax remains at the forefront of educational technology.
